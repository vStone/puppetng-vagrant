# PuppetNG Vagrant Environment.

## Introduction

Vagrant setup to quickly get up and running with development
for the puppetng bootstrap/puppet setup.

## Description

A package with puppet modules. This will configure a Puppet CA and
setup a base to deploy different components you might need in your
puppet setup. If you want an all-on-one-host puppetmaster setup, take
a look at theforeman. They have a foreman-installer which will pretty
much do that. This is more for advanced split up setups.

## Requirements

vagrant (1.2)
vagrant-hostmanager (>=0.4)
