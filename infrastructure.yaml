# The infrastructure file should be a yaml formatted file.
# It should contain the key infrastructure and contain 2 hashes:
#
#   * nodes
#   * roles
#
####
infrastructure:
  nodes:
    # Nodes are matched on the fqdn.
    # Each node can/must have one or more roles
    #
    # Roles are configured by providing either
    #
    #   * a single string:  Single role in default pool (no pool configured)
    #   * an array:         Multiple roles in default pool (no pool configured)
    #   * a hashtable:      Single or multiple roles with pools:
    #                       A pool can be
    #                         * nil:      use default pool
    #                         * a string: single pool to use
    #                         * an array: multiple pools.
    #
    # In general, for simple setups, you can forget about the pools
    # altogether. It is only required if you want to have (for example)
    # multiple proxies that proxy to different masters.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    # singlerole.siexample.com:
    #   role: ca
    #
    # multirole.example.com:
    #   role: - ca
    #         - master
    #
    # multipools.example.com:
    #   role:
    #     proxy: - data-prod
    #            - default

    # pool (called default).

    # the default pool will be used. For multiple
    # ca servers, you should create different infrastructure
    # files on the ca server that will be the master.

    # Remember that there is only one ca. Using
    # other pools besides the default one will not
